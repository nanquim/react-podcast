However, he has no idea what Matt is about to discuss before each podcast, so it ends up being a hilarious half hour filled with education and laughs. Covering a wide range of topics like: Eminent Domain, Blue Laws, Stand Your Ground, The Pardon Power, listening to this podcast will make you a great dinner party guest. ",

These are just a few examples of people, events, and things from our past that have been lost to time. They\u2019re important in the greater context of our understanding of the world and how our past shaped our present, yet they never made it into history books. In this bi-weekly podcast, freelance journalist, Crystal Ponti, digs up extraordinary excerpts of forgotten history, bringing her passion and love of storytelling to each episode. Recently honored as one of the best history podcasts of 2018 (Uproxx), listeners have likened \u201cHistorium Unearthia\u201d to \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and said, \u201cCrystal\u2019s narration is concise and enrapturing, and the production value of her stories holds the audience\u2019s attention like only the best of radio programs. She delivers interesting and entertaining stories from the lost parts of history, and, not only does she unearth them, she brings them to life.\u201d",

Reviews on iTunes and personal emails to me have expressed your fondness for Mr. Harvey and importance of his message.\n\nThe source for the audio files for this podcast had stated they were in the public domain. It turns out not be the case. For that reason, this podcast is discontinued and the episodes are removed.\n\nThe good news is that the original, studio-quality audio files for The Rest of the Story and the News and Commentary shows have survived. At some point in the future, these will be available to the public. I suggest that you monitor their availability by checking in with the paulharvey.com website from time to time. A quick search of the Internet reveals sources to purchase Mr. Harvey\u2019s books. ",

When the&nbsp;following night another couple is&nbsp;brutally slaughtered, panic spreads among Los Angeles&nbsp;residents.&nbsp;Four months later, the mastermind behind these vicious crimes is arrested, and the public learns the name that would haunt it to this day: Charles Manson.

And the true stories of the people and inventions that have built our world are often lost to time. Our only hope for building a better future is to truly understand what got us to the present. From the famous, to the infamous, to the never heard of, these are the unknown backstories of people who have changed the world. In Season 8, award-winning actor Alec Baldwin uncovers the little known backstories of veterans who have built companies, products, and brands that have changed the way we live.",

In 81 minutes they stole 13 pieces of artwork, among the paintings stripped from their frames were works by Vermeer, Degas, and Rembrandt. In this series Tim Pilleri &amp; Lance Reenstierna (of the Missing Maura Murray and Crawlspace podcasts) will dig as deep as possible into the case, theories, and social and economic impact the greatest unsolved art heist of all time had on the community.\n\nSeason 2: Tim Pilleri and Lance Reenstierna broaden their art crime horizons with a six episode season exploring a wide range of topics in the art crime genre. We talk to Turbo about a stolen da Vinci, the guys from Manzanita Ridge in Silver City, New Mexico who share an amazing story of stolen art recovery, and we talk to reporter Asa Romano about Banksy's shredding stunt at Sotheby's in London.\n\nSeason 3: We hope to return to the Gardner heist. Coming Spring 2019. \n\nThis show is available in full on Stitcher Premium. Use code FRAMES for a free month.\n    ",

      "description": "SHIELDS HIGH: The Battles That Saved Western Civilization\r\n \r\nFrom nationally syndicated radio host Buck Sexton, a new podcast that looks at the epic struggles that- had they gone the other way- could have extinguished the western world as we know it.  From the Persians of Xerxes to the Janissaries of the Ottoman Sultan, on many occasions vast and powerful forces nearly conquered the Western world before it ever could be realized. It was only through the valiant last stands of armies led by champions from Charles Martel to Don Juan of Austria that the West- the greatest force for human freedom, liberty, and knowledge in history-fought back and won. This series will explore those heroes and the momentous battles that reverberate from ancient times to present.",
